        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Danny Davies. Iâ€™m a 30-something-year-old digital product designer and occasional writer of CSS currently living in Blackpool, UK.</p>
        <p>By day, I run <a href="#">Circle</a> - a creative product agency for bright ideas. We're brand new, but we're working with start-ups that share our values; creating brands, websites and products that are both thoughtful and beautiful.</p>
        <p>After hours, I work on <a href="#">shape&colour</a> - a shop for simple, beautifully crafted prints. Iâ€™m also half of <a href="#">Simple</a> - a tiny creative workshop for delightful products. Our first product is <a href="#">Worked</a>, an intelligent portfolio platform for professional creatives.</p>
        <p>Before all this, I was the lead design at Vibe Group, senior product designer at Tiny, creative designer at Moshen and a bunch of other roles you can ask me about. As a consultant iâ€™ve crafted all manner of creative things for brands like the Premier League, JD Sports, Ocado, AO.com and Mamas & Papas.</p>
        <p>You can find me all over the internet. <a class="medium" href="#">Medium</a>, <a class="twitter" href="#">Twitter</a>, <a class="instagram" href="#">Instagram</a>, <a class="dribbble" href="#">Dribbble</a> and <a class="apple" href="#">Apple Music</a>. Come and say hello ðŸ‘‹</p>
