        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Danny. Iâ€™m a 30-something-year-old digital product designer and occasional writer of CSS currently living in Blackpool, UK.</p>
        <p>I currently lead the brand and product design over at <a href="#" title="VibePay">VibePay</a>, where we're making payments instant, free and easy. I was the lead design at Circle, senior product designer at Tiny, creative designer at Moshen and have worked with loads of other <a href="#" title="Work">companies</a>.</p>
        <p>As a consultant iâ€™ve crafted all manner of creative things for brands like Mamas&Papas, Ocado, The Premier League, JD Sports and <a href="#" title="Work">a few more</a>.</p>
        <p>I work on a few projects after hours. I run a shop for simple, beautifully crafted prints at <a href="#" title="shape&colour">shape&colour</a>. Iâ€™m half of <a href="#" title="Simple">Simple</a> - a tiny creative workshop for delightful products. We're brand new, but we're working with start-ups that share our values; creating brands, websites and products that are both thoughtful and beautiful. Our first product is <a href="#" title="Worked">Worked</a>, an intelligent portfolio platform for professional creatives.</p>
